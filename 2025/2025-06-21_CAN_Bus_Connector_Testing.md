# CAN Bus Connector Testing
2025-06-20

Given the difficulty of handling the existing connectors,
their poor documentation,
and lack of reputable sourcing,
I want to try using Anderson Power Pole PP15 connectors instead.

The wire gauge is too small for the PP15 connector,
but we could crimp a wire ferrule on first then crimp a PP15 over it.

## Proposed By
- Joshua Turner

## Departments
- Electrical Engineering

## Objectives
- Verify whether the CAN Bus cables on SPARK Max MC's can be used with Anderson Power Pole PP15 connectors
- Verify that a PP15 crimped over a wire ferrule is mechanically secure and electrically sound 
- Decide if we want to use PP15's for CAN Bus or come up with a new solution for the old connectors

## Materiel Requirements
- PP15 connectors ~10
- wire ferrule ~10
- this should not require buying more than we need to keep stocked ordinarily
- we do need to check if the ferrule we have are for the same gauge as the SPARK Max connector.

# Notes
Using PP15's and ferrule means we can get connectors faster form McMaster and,
for ferrule, free from Automation Direct.
